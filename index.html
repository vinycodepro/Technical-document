      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>Roads are critical to the development of any society. They connect cities, facilitate trade, and provide mobility for people and goods. Road construction in civil engineering involves a systematic process that includes <code>planning</code>, <code>design</code>, <code>material selection</code>, and <code>actual construction</code>. Each stage ensures that the final road is durable, cost-effective, and safe for users.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="survey_and_design">
      <header><h2>Survey and Design</h2></header>
      <p>The first step in road construction is surveying and design. Surveying involves studying the physical environment where the road will be built. Tools such as <code>total stations</code>, <code>levels</code>, drones, and GPS devices help engineers gather data on terrain, elevation, and existing features.</p>
      <p>Once the data is collected, civil engineers use software like AutoCAD or Civil 3D to create road alignment drawings. These include the horizontal alignment (path of the road), vertical alignment (elevations and slopes), and cross-sections (cut and fill data). Good design ensures minimal earthwork, <code>proper drainage</code>, and long-term performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="earthwork">
      <header><h2>Earthwork</h2></header>
      <p>Earthwork is one of the most intensive phases of road construction. It involves preparing the natural ground to support the road structure. Based on the design, the site is either excavated (cut) or filled with earth material to achieve the required road level.</p>
      <p>Heavy machinery such as <code>bulldozers</code>, graders, and <code>excavators</code> are used for shaping the ground. After shaping, the soil is compacted using rollers to increase its strength and stability. Proper compaction is critical to prevent road failure due to settlement.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="sub-base_&_base_course">
      <header><h2>Sub-base & Base Course</h2></header>
      <p>Once the subgrade (prepared earth surface) is ready, engineers lay the sub-base and base course. These are layers of crushed stone or gravel that distribute traffic loads to the subgrade and improve drainage.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sub-base:</strong> Typically made of granular materials like Granular Sub-Base (GSB). It provides a working platform for construction equipment and a buffer against frost or moisture.<br>
        <strong>Base Course:</strong> This is often constructed using <code>Water Bound Macadam (WBM)</code>, <code>Bituminous Macadam</code>, or <code>Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM)</code>, depending on the road type.
      </p>
      <p>Each layer is laid to a specific thickness and compacted thoroughly to achieve design strength.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="pavement_layer">
      <header><h2>Pavement Layer</h2></header>
      <p>The pavement is the topmost layer of a road, designed to resist wear and distribute loads. There are two main types of pavement used in civil engineering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexible Pavement:</strong> Made with bitumen (asphalt) and designed to flex slightly under traffic. It is common in highways and urban roads due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Rigid Pavement:</strong> Made with concrete. It is stronger and lasts longer but is more expensive and harder to repair.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bituminous pavement includes layers like the tack coat (for bonding), base bituminous course, and the surface wearing course. Each layer must be tested for density, thickness, and smoothness.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="drainage">
      <header><h2>Drainage</h2></header>
      <p>Good drainage is essential to prevent water from weakening the pavement structure. Engineers design both surface and subsurface drainage systems to channel water away from the road.</p>
      <p>Surface drainage includes cross slopes, side drains, and kerbs, while subsurface drainage may include perforated pipes and filters to prevent waterlogging. Poor drainage is a leading cause of potholes and early road failure.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="finishing_&_quality_control">
      <header><h2>Finishing & Quality Control</h2></header>
      <p>Once the pavement is laid, final finishing involves tasks like painting lane markings, placing signs, and installing guard rails. These improve road safety and guide traffic flow.</p>
      <p>Quality control is performed throughout the project. Engineers conduct tests for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compaction of soil and aggregates</li>
        <li>Bitumen temperature and mix design</li>
        <li>Surface smoothness using straight edges</li>
        <li>Thickness measurements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All test results are documented to verify that the road meets design and safety standards.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="maintenance">
      <header><h2>Maintenance</h2></header>
      <p>Even well-constructed roads need regular maintenance to extend their life. Maintenance can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Routine:</strong> Cleaning drains, removing vegetation, checking for cracks</li>
        <li><strong>Periodic:</strong> Re-sealing joints, overlaying with bitumen or slurry</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> Fixing potholes, landslides, or damage after accidents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Maintenance ensures continued road safety and helps reduce long-term repair costs.</p>
